      "description": "The espresso gave a nice crema and there was actual body to the smell and didnt smell watered down at all. There were spicy notes coming from the cup and that hint of rubber and nuts. Adding the foamed milk and tasting the coffee had real body and left a lovely strong coffee taste at the back of the throat with out that extreme bitterness. It seems a real quality coffee from initial impressions that's only going to get better as I get my machine dialled in"

      "description": "Coffee with an organic label must be roasted on a roaster dedicated to organic green beans, or on equipment that has been thoroughly cleaned between roasts. \nEven if the beans are certified organic, they can’t be labeled as such once they go into a roaster that has been used for non-certified beans. For this reason, most small batch roasters either sell all organic coffees, or none at all. And sometimes, for marketing reasons, we’ve seen roasted bean labeling highlighting organic beans, even though the equipment renders the roast non-organic. \n\nFinally, what goes for the roaster should also technically extend to the grinder and brewing equipment, which means that even beans grown, processed, or roasted in certified organic ways are, by organic standards, completely contaminated by the time you take a sip."
